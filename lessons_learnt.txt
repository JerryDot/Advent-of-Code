===========================
I regret folder names not being in chronological order when arranged alphabetically

Day One:
sets are much more performant than lists when applicable

Day Two:
Should be using context managers to handle file opening
Try/except blocks

Day Three:
Basic regex (not done very cleanly at all)
Some basic practice with using numpy arrays

Day Four:
Should be using functions to make the code more readable/understandable

Day Five:
Code runtime could be improved, function names could be clearer

Day Six:
Incomplete

Day Seven:
Relatively sensible

Day Eight:
Incomplete

Day Nine:
Deques (Python's implementation of doubly-linked lists)

Day Ten:
matplotlib.pyplot as a basic plotting tool

Day Eleven:
Likely defining too many variables
Could be split out into some more functions

Day Twelve:
Code is not very general - it is purely for the problem at hand

Day Thirteen:
Very incomplete

Day Fourteen:
Using pytest to run unit tests on code

string = ''.join(list)
